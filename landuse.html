							<h1>Land Use Classification</h1>
				
						
														<p>
											To map out the different land classifications in the Area of Utrecht, I used data from the satellite <strong>Sentinel-2</strong>, which contains a series of two Earth observation satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA) and is part of the Copernicus programme. This satellite focuses on providing vegetation information, depending on the wave signal they receive back<br/><br/>
</br>

I ended up creating an unsupervised pixel-based map. 
<ul>
  <li>Unsupervised= The software identifies natural groupings (clusters) in the data using algorithms like K-means or ISODATA.
</li>
  <li>Pixel-based=Classification is performed at the individual pixel level, using the pixelâ€™s spectral values (e.g., reflectance in different bands like red, green, near-infrared, etc.).</li>
<ul>
 </br></br>

This type of map showed the distinction between the water ways and dying vegetaion (as I compared in Google Maps) more clearly. Still, I suppose because of moisture levels and different species, the legend ended up not being the most accurate.

<p> Note: This is differentiated by points (seen in blue) within my area. The limitations of this data visualization is that my color differentiation was not working, so you are not able to see the difference between the spectral lines. Which is why the legend is not included, since it is all blue.
</br></br>

The point of the spectral analysis is to show that the satellite's data shows differentiation in the different types of land. It is to explain how this classification works.
	<ul>
<li>Profile 3: Water</li> 
<li>Profile 4: Agriculture </li>
<li>Profile 5: Forest </li>
<li>Profile 6: Urban </li>	
	  <ul>
</p>

						I noticed that the accuracy for this type of map was low, and I ran into a lot of difficulties during its creation. Upon further research, I found out that accuracy is up to 50% in areas of urban fringes and mixed shrub, grass and tree landscapes since these locations do not have a distinct pixel-cpnt for each class type and cannot be accurately separated by signal.

		  If data is accurate, these type of maps allow to define areas of different vegetation types and their stages (since the wave they emit changes), which can aid in proposing conservation plans, and guide urban planning.
